Simple 2D Physics engine.

All required libraries are added as submodules (except for glad which is implemented directly).
After downloading submodules run cmake and compile the project.



TODO:
- Event handling
- Collision detection
- Basic Physics (Forces, interactions, gravity, etc.)
- Particle System
- Fluid Simulation
