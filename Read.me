Simple 2D Physics engine.

All required libraries are added as submodules (except for glad which is implemented directly).
After downloading submodules run cmake and compile the project.



TODO:
1. Event handling
2. Basic Physics (Forces, interactions, gravity, etc.)
3. Collision detection
4. Particle System
5. Fluid Simulation
